## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

The Alumni Association Platform will enable GEC alumni to stay connected, share career opportunities, make donations, and participate in events. It will be both a web application (for computers) and a mobile application (for smartphones).

### Working of the solution:

#### Frontend (What the User Sees):
  
1. Web Application: This is the version that alumni access through their computer's web browser. It will enable alumni to register, update their profiles, donate, and interact with the platform.
2. Mobile Application: The mobile app will have the same features as the web app but will be designed for smartphones. It will be available for iOS and Android devices, and thus, the alumni can use the platform on the go.

#### Backend (What Happens Behind the Scenes):
This is the location where all data - alumnus profiles, job postings, donations, event details, etc. are held and maintained. It's the "engine" of this whole process.
In terms of an alumnus updating his or her profile, registering for an event, or making a donation, it sends information to the backend to be processed and placed into a database.

### Detailed Architecture

#### Frontend (User Interface):

1. Web App: This web app will be built using React.js. It allows alumni to access the platform from any web browser on their computer.
Mobile App: The mobile app will be built using React Native (or Flutter), so it can run on both iOS and Android phones. It will allow alumni to access all features from their mobile devices.
Backend (Server-side):

2. API Gateway: The API Gateway is like a middle man. It receives requests (such as login or profile updates) from the web and mobile applications and forwards them to the right service, such as registration or donations.

#### Backend Services: These are smaller components that perform specific tasks. For instance:
1. User Service: These manage user registration, logins, and profiles
2. Donation Service: manages alumni donations and payment process
3. Job Portal Service: manages job postings and applicant applications.
4. Event Service: Manages events like reunions and workshops.
Each of these services communicates with the database to store or retrieve data.

#### Database:
The database stores all the important data like:
1. Alumni Profiles: Name, graduation year, profession, contact details.
2. Job Postings: Information about job openings posted by alumni.
3. Donations: Details of the money donated by alumni.
4. Event Registrations: Information about which alumni are attending which events.
We will make use of a cloud database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL that can be easily updated and scaled with more users joining the platform.

## Technology Stack

In order to effectively create the Alumni Association Platform, we'll use a mix of various technologies. All technologies are built to perform some particular role—some in managing how the platform would look and feel (front-end) while others in logic and data (back-end) management. We can break this down into simple components:

### Frontend (User Interface)
The frontend is what the users (alumni) interact with when they visit the platform. This is the part of the platform that runs in the web browser (for the web app) or on mobile phones (for the mobile app).

#### For the Web Application:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): This is the basic structure of a webpage. It defines headings, paragraphs, buttons, and forms.
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): This is used to make the web pages look nice. It controls colors, fonts, and layout.
3. JavaScript: This is used to make the web pages interactive. For example, when alumni click a button to register, JavaScript will make things happen on the page without needing to refresh the whole page.
4. React.js: The most popular JavaScript library used to create the user interface of the web application. It makes an application more responsive and fast.

#### Mobile Application:

1. React Native: This is a framework that helps in developing cross-platform applications for iOS and Android mobile devices with JavaScript and React. One can write an application once and then deploy it to both the platforms.
2. Flutter (Alternative to React Native): Flutter is another framework for building mobile apps. It's made by Google and lets you build apps for both iOS and Android from a single codebase.

2. Backend (Server-side)
 The backend is like the "engine" of the platform. It handles all logic (like user registration) and connects to the database (where data is stored).

### Backend Framework:
1. Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that runs on the server side. It allows you to write backend code using JavaScript, making it easier for developers who already know JavaScript.
2. Express.js: A framework on top of Node.js, helping manage the server, requests from users, and making it easier to develop APIs that will allow both web and mobile applications to communicate with the backend
### Database (Store Data)
This is the place where all the information, including alumni profiles, job postings, donations, and event registrations, among others, is stored.

1. MySQL or PostgreSQL: These are relational databases, which store data in tables. They help organize and store information, like alumni details (name, graduation year, career) and donation history. You can easily query the database to retrieve or update information.
2. MongoDB (Alternative to MySQL/PostgreSQL): This is NoSQL database that stores its data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It's good for projects where the structure of the data may change often or need more flexibility.

### Cloud Hosting and Deployment
After the platform is built, it should be hosted on a server for users to access.

1. AWS or Google Cloud: These are cloud services where you can host the web app, mobile backend, and database of your platform. Cloud hosting will make the platform scale up with more alumni joining and using the platform.
2. Heroku (for beginners): is an application platform for deploying web applications and backend services, easy to use, hence setting up your platform quickly without having to deal with servers.

### Summary of the Technology Stack:
1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (web), React Native (mobile)
2. Backend: Node.js, Express.js
3. Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL or MongoDB
4. Payment: Stripe or Razorpay
5. Authentication: JWT, OAuth
6. Cloud Hosting: AWS/Google Cloud or Heroku
7. Notifications: Firebase
8. Version Control: Git, GitHub/GitLab
